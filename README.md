# iga-demos

This repository contains an isogeometric analysis demos for 2D linear elasticity.

In this demo we discretize the classical linear elastostatics equations using the Galerkin method based on isogeometric function spaces. We follow the notation used in [1] and Bezier extraction [2]. A more mathematical view on the finite element method can be found in [3]. Regarding isogeometric analysis we refer to the first paper [4] and the book [5].
